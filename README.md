Submitted by: **Stephanie Saenz**

**HW 23** is an app that introduces multiple ways to view information about movies that are playing right now. User can see a tab bar controller with two options, 'movies' and 'posters'. The movies option displays the movies on a table view cell with info to the right of the image, while in the posters tab only the image of the movie is shown as a grid view. Both options allows you to see more information like vote count and popularity once the movie is clicked on.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Implement network call and table view to display a list of movies currently playing (title, description, image)
- [X] App has a collection view with the same list of movies
- [X] Uses a tab bar controller to switch between collection view and table view screens
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Make an additional network call to another end-point.	
- [X] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Change the tab bar controller to black.
- Add more features like a rating scale of the movie to show vote count or popularity.
  
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-The main challenge while building the app is figuring out how to code the posterviewcontroller to make the images of the movies show up on it.
- Also HW23, is named this way because I duplicated my hw2 file but named it hw3 on a new folder.
